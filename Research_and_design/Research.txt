*
When you select an input text box, change select css class to hover the yellow
hover color you have everywhere else.

*
need to set the selected psuedo classes for a lot of elements

*
make the toggle button your own.
idea: you can do an animation, where clicking the toggle button drops
	the forward slash down below the word "Edit" in the h2 title.
	you can also add a kind of light effect.. im just going to draw it.
	the drawing is in your schedule book.

*I want to think about how to do this next part. 
------> need to plan and think about the code you'll write.
		the more you plan, the less likely you are to go back and
		have to redo things (or the entire thing).
- Disable certain select lists in the NewCardArea based on toggle 
-> for example, user shouldn't be able to use the select card list if they're
	just adding a card to the deck
--> achieve this with: pointer-events:none; and also change the color to a gray

- After all that, handle the logic behind edit/add on the backend
