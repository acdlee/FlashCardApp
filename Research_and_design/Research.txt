When you select an input text box, change select css class to hover the yellow
hover color you have everywhere else.

need to set the selected psuedo classes for a lot of elements


let's clean up some of this code

Okay, so now where are we. 
- Add Deck for card seciton

I think I need to redo a lot of this.
Something to keep in mind is the page will rerender when a state changes.
For all our forms, there should be an onChange that updates the state to whatever we selected.
That should update all the lists.
We can test this in a controlled environment (ie a new project). Or we can just make a mess. :)
Apparently reducers are nice when you have state pieces that are depedent on each other, and usestate
    is nice for indepedent states.
    -> so maybe i do have a bunch of cases for usereducer.
