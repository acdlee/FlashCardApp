Okay, so we need to figure out how to implement the DB class into the app.
Currently, we just use a DATA variable (array of an array of objects that represent flashcards).

Ideally, we'd use the db class everywhere instead.

BUT, I'm sure it's possible to just provide the same DATA variable by extracting
and formatting the same data from the db class.

I think best practice would be to use the class, however. Let's go with that.

When you select an input text box, change select css class to hover the yellow
hover color you have everywhere else.

Make a deck_options state
When you add a new deck name, also update the deck options state

I think the best way to do this is to use an empty state array at first
Then you populate as you go.
Ex:
usestate([initial deck names])
onChangeAddDeck->
    setDeckNames() -> include new deck
and then make the deck options jsx somewhere else
