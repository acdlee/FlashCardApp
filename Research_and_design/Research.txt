When you select an input text box, change select css class to hover the yellow
hover color you have everywhere else.

need to set the selected psuedo classes for a lot of elements


- Found a "hacky" way to update the chapter names:
When you add a new chapter in the NewChapterArea, you update
and arbitrary state associated with chapter names in the parent, and you pass
that state to the Cards area and add that state to the useEffect that updates the chapter
options based on the currentDeck state.
--> Basically, add a dummy state variable that goes from NewChapterArea to 
EditAddCardArea and add that state to the useEffect that deals with creating 
the chapter options
