When you select an input text box, change select css class to hover the yellow
hover color you have everywhere else.

need to set the selected psuedo classes for a lot of elements


OKAY, so now it's time for the actual Add/Edit logic of this page (lol).

- Need UI for a toggle: allow the user to choose their action (Adding vs Editing a card)
-> I want to place this toggle botton right between New Card and Add Card Button
-> Update the text in the button to the right; alternate between "Add Card" and "Edit Card"
-> Trigger the click styling when you toggle the button, so the user is directed on 
	what changed/what's happened

- Disable certain select lists in the NewCardArea based on toggle 
-> for example, user shouldn't be able to use the select card list if they're
	just adding a card to the deck
--> achieve this with: pointer-events:none; and also change the color to a gray

- After all that, handle the logic behind edit/add on the backend
